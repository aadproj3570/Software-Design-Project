# Software-Design-Project

## Project Description

> We were tasked to build a software application that will predict the rate of the fuel based on the following criteria: <br />
>- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state) <br />
>- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new) <br />
>- Gallons requested <br />
>- Company profit margin (%) <br /> 

> We included the following components: <br />
>- Login (Allow Client to register if not a client yet) <br />
>- Client Registration (Initially only username and Password) <br />
>- Client Profile Management (after client registers they should login first to complete profile) <br />
>- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost) <br />
>- Fuel Quote History <br /> <br /> <br />
